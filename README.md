### 4. Set Up Google API Credentials

To make the Google Login work, you need to have your **Google API credentials**. Follow these steps to set them up:

2. Create a **new project** (or use an existing one).
3. Enable the **Google+ API** (or **Google Identity Services**).
4. Generate an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** for your web application.
5. Add the **client_id** in the environment variables or directly in the code where itâ€™s used.

- Ensure you have the correct **Redirect URIs** set.
- Make sure to add the **JavaScript origins** in the Google Cloud Console for your app's domain.
  
  
### 5. Start the Development Server

Now, you're ready to run the application locally. Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
